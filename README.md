# ESP-01 demo

Theoretically, the [ESP-01 I've bought](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000140068083.html) should have been configured as [esp01_1m (Generic ESP8266 ESP-01 1M)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif8266/esp01_1m.html) on PlatformIO. However, it works flawlessly (and out-of-the-box) when configured as [nodemcuv2 (ESP-12E)](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/espressif8266/nodemcuv2.html).

I've kept both working configurations.
